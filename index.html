<!--Mission statement-->
<div class="container-fluid">
    <h1>Mission statement:</h1>
    <p>First Time Programmers is a UF ACM Special Interest Group dedicated to helping students programming for the first time overcome the learning curve of programming, expand their knowledge beyond what is taught in a classroom, and become assimilated into the Computer Science community, ACM, and programming culture.</p>
</div>
<!--What we do-->
<div class="container-fluid">
    <h1>What we do:</h1>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a welcoming, empowering community for those entering the realm of programming. To assist new programmers, we host three programs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Compliments: Our companion tutorial series for Programming Fundamentals 1 (COP3502). Perfect for those who have barely or never programmed before, whether you're in COP3502 or not!</li>
        <li>Supplements: Our tutorial series on anything programming that's not taught in class. Learn about topics such as web page design, GitHub, hackathons, and more! Little to no programming experience is required!</li>
        <li>Mentor-mentee program: Our program for getting you a go-to guy or gal for your programming journey. Meeting others in the programming community can be intimidating, and programming itself can get frustrating. Having an experienced friend can help alleviate both your networking and programming struggles immensely!</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!--Additionally-->
<div class="container-fluid">
    <p>Additionally, we also do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tutorial recordings: For those days where you can't make it to an event.</li>
        <li>Emergency office hours: For those days when you're clueless and your test or project is due in a few hours.</li>
        <li>Active FTP Facebook group community: For those days when your head hurts from hitting it against your desk too much</li>
    </ul>
